## Purpose

In 2014, LIGO confirmed the existence of gravitational waves. Since then, gravitational waves became a useful tool to explore the early universe and even fundamental physics. A variety of the ways to detect gravitational waves are on-going and proposed, covering vast range of the gravitational wave frequency bands.

One of the observable gravitational wave sources is a phase transition in the early universe, leading to bubbles and/or topological defects. Axion, one of the dark matter candidates, also predicts hybrid type topological defects. Therefore, now will be a high time to understand the basic properties of topological defects originating in the fundamental physics. Topological defects are also important in low energy physics such as superconducters. 

Our purpose of this workshop is to share and discuss recent progress and new ideas on frontiers in gravity and fundamental physics and
to trigger the interplay between fundamental physicists and cosmologists.

This workshop is on-site.

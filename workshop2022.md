## Pupose

The universe has misteries to be understood: the origin of dark matter, baryon anti-baryon asymmetry, the smallness of the neutrino masses, etc. 
In 2014, LIGO confirmed the existance of gravitational waves throught the detection from binary black holes,
and gravitational waves became a useful tool to explore the early universe and even high energy physics. 
Our purpose of this workshop is to share and discuss recent progress on how to extract clue to misteries of the universe from gravitational waves.
To accomplish this purpose, we invite both experts and young physicists in this field.
